## 👋 Hi there!
I'm Rong Ding, a researcher and model developer with a keen interest in how language and meaning are processed by humans and by biologically inspired systems/models (e.g., AI). I build computational models that bridge natural language, human data (behavioural/neural), and structured semantics.

### 🔍 Currently exploring
- How symbolic representations (ontologies, knowledge graphs) can be combined with semantic embeddings and neural networks
- How AI models augment reconstruction and symbolic representation of non-linear system dynamics (e.g., in the brain)

### 🛠️ Featured projects
- [ModellingHumanReading](https://github.com/Rong-Ding/ModellingHumanReading): Comparing Word2Vec models in handling word semantics, and SRN vs LSTM models in syntactic ambiguity (garden-path sentences)
- [DecodingUnderPartialObservability](https://github.com/Rong-Ding/DecodingUnderPartialObservability): Building Autoencoders that effectively reconstruct latent states and system dynamics under varying degrees of (partial) observability
- [Coupled_STiMCON](https://github.com/Rong-Ding/Coupled_STiMCON): A neural (oscillatory) model that combines internal language knowledge (predictability) with external inputs in speech processing
